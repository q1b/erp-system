        "description": "Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning is one of the top-notch careers of this new decade. Technology is such a field, which never gets static. It’s a dynamic branch of sweeping innovations and experiments. \nWhile Artificial intelligence is driving towards creating a simulation of human intelligence and behavior, Machine learning on the other hand is a subset of AI that enables a computer system to make predictions or take some decisions using historical data without being explicitly programmed. \nAccording to research, it’s estimated that about 30 percent of all the B2B companies will be employing AI to boost at least one of their sales processes. This throws light, on a very important aspect of this field, the ‘job demand’ in the market. With a BTech in the field, one would expect much higher returns in comparison to other traditional engineering fields."
